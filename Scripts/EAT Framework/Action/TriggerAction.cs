    /// The former will be activated absolutely when the VRExplorer started to trigger a TriggerableEntity.
    /// The latter will be activated later, when the VRExplorer finished to trigger the TriggerableEntity.
    /// For instance, a button is a TriggerableEntity. When the VRExplorer presses it,
    /// the button switched to the triggerring state. And when the VRExplorer releases it,
    /// the button switched to the triggered state.
    /// A joystick is also a triggerableEntity.
